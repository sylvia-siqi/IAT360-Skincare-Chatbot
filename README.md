# IAT360-Skincare-Chatbot
## Project Idea
A chatbot that answers questions about skincare product and ingredients based on a dataset.

## Potential Bias, Privacy or Ethical Issue
- Bias issues: The dataset might reflect limited perspectives, focusing on common ingredients while missing the less-known or culturally specific ones. Since skincare is subjective, the model might not adequately serve users with different standards of beauty, skin tones, ethnicities, or cultural practices.
- Privacy Issue: As the dataset does not include personal data and the model will not save user input for future reference, the risk of privacy concerns is low.
- Ethical Issue: There is a possibility of recommending ingredients with adverse effects, especially for uncommon skin conditions or allergies that are not well-represented in the dataset.
